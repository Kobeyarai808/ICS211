These classes create a Huffman Tree data structure that is ultimately used to encode ASCII characters. The BitString is able to convert between bits and bytes. In addition, it also allows adding bits to the BitString up until a maximum of 8 bits in a byte. The Huffman class adds characters into the Huffman tree to be encoded, it implements Huffman nodes which is used to store the value along with references to the left and right children. Frequency of the entire sub-tree is also stored in the Huffman node.
