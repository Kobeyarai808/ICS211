1. I Opened Reversible.java and noticed that the constructor is static, Constructors are not supposed to 
	be static because then in means it belongs to the class. 

2. After taking a look at ReversibleDriver.java, I noticed that the variable count was never initialized. 

3. I noticed the when constructing a Reversible object the variable done was set to true in the beginning so the while 
	loop will never run. Fixed it by setting it to false in the beginning. 

3. I then saw that the program was trying to assign a String to an int, after reviewing the comments, it seems like temp
	is trying to reverse the integer input. Therefore, at the end where the program is assigning the String to an int, 
	it is necessary to parse the String to an int variable type. 
	
4. At this point, I could not find any other bugs through inspection and was not getting desired output, this is when
	I decided to flood my program with debug print statements. Through doing so, I found that the verifyOdds()
	method was broken.
	
5. Inside of the verifyOdds, if the numbers in the middle were not odd, it would return true when it should have 
	returned false. 
	
6. Now I am at the point where I have 125 numbers that meet the criteria. I am now at the point where my print statements 
	are no longer of assistance so I commented them out. I have now resorted to manually checking numbers to see if they 
	work.
	
7. I have come to the conclusion that "leading zeros" mean numbers like 10 should return false when it currently does 
	not. To fix this, I added input%10!=0 to the if statement that verifies sum.
